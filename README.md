Resilient Supply Chain System for Small Businesses Problem Statement: Small businesses often face inventory disruptions when suppliers fail to deliver on time. These delays can cause stockouts, missed sales opportunities, and dissatisfied customers. Unlike large enterprises, small businesses typically lack access to advanced supply chain tools that can automate responses, leaving them vulnerable to operational inefficiencies and revenue loss. Proposed Solution: Develop a resilient supply chain system that monitors supplier performance, potential delays, and automatically recommends or executes corrective actions. The system will: • Use historical supplier data to forecast delivery risks. • Suggest alternative suppliers or routes in case of disruptions. • Automate reordering to prevent stockouts while minimizing overstock. • Provide observability dashboards for tracking supplier performance and inventory levels. Expected Impact: • Reduced stockout events and improved order fulfilment. • Increased operational efficiency and resilience for small businesses. • Enhanced ability to maintain customer satisfaction despite supply chain uncertainties. Constraints: • Limited number of suppliers and variable delivery times. • Partial visibility into logistics networks. • Budget and infrastructure limitations typical of small enterprises.
